# File & Directory Manager

## Overview
The **File & Directory Manager** is a collection of Bash scripts designed to automate various file and directory management tasks. This includes functionalities such as listing files, creating backups, counting files, checking disk usage, searching for files, and compressing files. The program also logs all actions performed into a log file for easy tracking.

## Features
- **List Files**: Lists all files in a specified directory, showing their sizes, permissions, and timestamps.
- **Create Backup**: Creates a backup of a specified file or directory.
- **Count Files**: Counts the total number of files in a specified directory.
- **Check Disk Usage**: Displays the total disk usage of a specified directory.
- **Search for Files**: Searches for files by name or extension in a specified directory.
- **Compress Files**: Compresses a file or directory into a `.tar.gz` archive.
- **Logging**: Logs all actions performed into a file called `script.log`.
